				<p>What you should do:</p>
				<ul class="list list-bullet">
					<li>keep track of the weather and water levels</li>
					<li>get ready to act on your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-flood-plan">flood plan</a> if you have one</li>
					<li>move vehicles to higher ground if it’s safe to do so</li>
					<li>prepare a flood kit of essential items including a torch with spare batteries, mobile phone and charger, warm clothes, home insurance documents, water, food, first aid kit and any prescription medicines or baby care items you need</li>
					<li>check you know how to turn off your gas, electricity and water mains supplies</li>
					<li>in rural locations, farmers should consider moving livestock and equipment away from areas likely to flood</li>
