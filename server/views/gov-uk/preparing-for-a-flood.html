			<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Preparing for a flood</h1>
			
			<p>How to find out if you’re at risk and plan ahead for flooding.</p>

			<p>You can <a href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk">find out if your property is in an area at risk from flooding</a>. If it is, there are several things you can do to prepare in advance.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Protect your property</h2>
			<p>There are devices that help prevent water from entering your property, like flood boards, non-return valves and air brick covers. There are also ways to limit the damage floodwater can do inside your property, like fitting solid floors and raising the level of power sockets.</p>
			<p>For more information on advance measures, get the National Flood Forum’s property protection guides for <a href="http://www.smartfloodprotection.com/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2014/09/property_owners_guidance_revised.pdf">property owners</a> or for <a href="http://www.smartfloodprotection.com/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2014/02/Six-Steps-LA-Professional-web-v3-July2014.pdf">local authorities and professionals</a>.</p>
			<p>Simple maintenance like keeping drains and gullies clear of debris will also help protect your property.</p>
			<h3 class="heading-small">If you live near a watercourse</h3>
			<p>There is specific guidance If you own property or live:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/riverside-ownership-rights-and-responsibilities">beside a river</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/contact-us/contacting-our-offices">next to a canal</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2 class="heading-medium">Check your insurance</h2>
			<p>Make sure your household insurance covers you for flooding. If you live in rented property, make sure your landlord’s insurance covers your possessions.</p>
			<p>If you’re in a high-risk area you may be eligible for affordable insurance from <a href="https://www.floodre.co.uk">Flood Re</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Take ‘before’ pictures</h2>
			<p>Take detailed photos of your property and contents now. They will help you prove that any flood damage was not there before.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Sign up for flood warnings</h2>
			<p>If you live in a flood warning area <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-up-for-flood-warnings">sign up for flood warnings</a> and you’ll be alerted by phone, email or text about potential flooding in your area. Note: flood warnings are not available for all locations.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Know how to turn off your gas, electricity and water</h2>
			<p>Find out where and how to turn off your gas, electricity and water supplies. If you leave your home because of a flood, you’ll need to turn them off.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Think about vulnerable family and neighbours, and pets</h2>
			<p>Your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-flood-plan">flood plan</a> should include what you’ll do for those who need additional help, and an evacuation plan for pets.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Write down important numbers</h2>
			<p>Keep a list of important numbers (including your GP’s details, insurance claim line and your policy number). This could go in your emergency kit (see below).</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Make a flood plan</h2>
			<p>You can use templates to make a flood plan for:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-flood-plan">your household</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flood-plan-guidance-for-communities-and-groups">your local community or group</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flood-plan-guidance-for-communities-and-groups">your business</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The templates will help you to record the important information you need in one place and tell you what to do if flooding is imminent or has happened.</p>
