			<h2 class="heading-medium no-top-margin">Contact your insurance company</h2>
			<p>If you haven’t done this already, call your insurance company and follow their advice. If you live in rented property, check that your landlord’s insurance covers flooding.</p>
			<p>If you haven’t got insurance, the <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverContactYourInsurance:National_flood_forum" href="http://www.nationalfloodforum.org.uk">National Flood Forum</a> can offer help and support. Call them on 01299 403055.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Get help</h2>
			<h3 class="heading-small">Find your local flood action group or flood warden</h3>
			<p>If there’s been a serious flood, your local authority may have chosen a place like the town hall as a ‘flood hub’ from which to organise recovery efforts.</p>
			<p>You may have a nearby flood warden or flood action group. Contact the <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverContactYourInsurance:National_flood_forum" href="http://www.nationalfloodforum.org.uk">National Flood Forum</a> for help in finding local support.</p>
			<h3 class="heading-small">Apply for financial aid</h3>
			<p>You may be able to get financial aid for flood recovery. Apply to <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverGetHelp:your_local_council" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">your local council</a>.</p>
			<h3 class="heading-small">Get emotional support</h3>
			<p>Having a flooded home is very stressful. If you need emotional support, contact family and friends, your doctor or an organisation like the <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverGetHelp:Red_cross" href="http://www.redcross.org.uk">Red Cross</a> or the <a href="https://www.samaritans.org">Samaritans</a>.</p>
			<p>Public Health England offers <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverGetHelp:a_guide_to_mental_wellbeing" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/483387/Health_advice_about_mental_health_following_floods_2015.pdf">a guide to mental wellbeing</a> after a flood.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Check if you can return home</h2>
			<p>If you’ve had to leave your home, check with the emergency services that it’s safe before you return.</p>
			<p>Your home or business may also need a safety inspection by the utility companies before you can turn the water, gas and electricity back on.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Clean up</h2>
			<p>Before you start cleaning, take photographs to document damage and record the flood water height. Ask your insurer before discarding items that cannot be cleaned (like mattresses and carpets).</p>
			<p>Find out <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverCleanUp:how_to_clean_up_your_home_safely" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/348920/Flooding_how_to_clean_up_your_house_safely.pdf">how to clean up your home safely</a> after a flood.</p>
			<p>Your local authority should help with collecting large flood damaged items. They’ll tell you where to put them and when they may be collected.</p>
			<p>You can dispose of used sandbags at your local tip. If you think they are contaminated by chemicals or sewage, contact <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverCleanUp:your_local_council" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">your local council</a> and ask how to dispose of them.</p>
			<p>You can put most other things in the bin if they’re not polluted. Contact the council if you need skips or extra rubbish collections.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Stay healthy</h2>
			<p>Flood water may contain sewage, chemicals and animal waste which can cause diseases. When cleaning your home after a flood always wear gloves, a face mask and sturdy footwear.</p>
			<p>You can find general advice about <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverStayHealthy:Staying_healthy_after_a_flood" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flooding-questions-and-answers-about-health">staying healthy after a flood</a> at Public Health England.</p>
			<p>If you notice a change in the colour, taste or smell of your tap water, stop using it and phone your water company.</p>
			<p>You can get support from your <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverStayHealthy:your_local_health_team" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">your local health protection team</a> to prevent and reduce the effect of diseases.</p>
			<p>Don’t eat food that’s touched flood water. If your electricity is off, don’t eat fresh food from a fridge after 4 hours or from a freezer after 24 hours.</p>
			<p>The Food Standards Agency offers detailed <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverStayHealthy:food_safety_advice" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/science/microbiology/flood%20">food safety advice</a> for flood victims.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Make repairs</h2>
			<p>Contact your insurance company before you begin any repairs. Most repair work after flooding will need to be done by approved traders appointed by your insurer. </p>
			<p>If you use heaters or dehumidifiers to dry out your property, make sure there’s good ventilation. Never use petrol or diesel-powered generators indoors; their exhaust gases contain potentially lethal carbon monoxide.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Prepare for future floods</h2>
			<p>Read the National Flood Forum's advice on how to <a data-journey-click="PRR:recoverPrepareForFutureFloods:protect_your_property_from_flooding_in_the_future" href="https://nationalfloodforum.org.uk/about-flooding/reducing-your-risk/protecting-your-property/">protect your property from flooding in the future</a>. </p>
			<p>You could take measures such as laying tiles instead of carpets, moving electrical sockets higher up the walls and fitting non-return valves. </p>
