				Your phone number has been automatically opted-in to receive flood warnings		
			</h1>
			
			<p class="lede">In England, the Environment Agency sends flood warnings to phone numbers registered in areas at risk of flooding from rivers or the sea. The service is anonymous and free.</p>
			
			<h2 class="heading-medium">Why did we send you this message?</h2>
			<p>We have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-responsibilities-of-responder-agencies-and-others">legal duty</a> to warn people who may be at risk of flooding so they can take action to protect themselves, their family and property.</p>
			<p>This phone number was automatically added to the list of numbers to which we send flood warnings. This is because it was registered in an area thatâ€™s at risk of flooding in the future and that may have flooded in the past. </p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">How did we get your number?</h2>
			<p>We tell phone companies about areas at risk of flooding. They send us a list of the phone numbers registered in those areas. </p>
			<p>They do not give us the names or addresses associated with those numbers. We store the numbers securely, in line with our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a>.</p>
